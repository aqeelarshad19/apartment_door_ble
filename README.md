# Making your apartment lock smart with Bluetooth Low Energy(BLE)
> During the times of Covid-19, its time to make a contact-less door opener

## Background
During the corona crises, I decided to open the apartment door using my smart phone. I have documented in here, [Github](https://github.com/aqeelarshad19/apartment_door_connected). It consisted of an esp8266 connected via Wifi to be connected to a cloud platform and a relay to drive the button. 
The problem with Wifi and electromechanical relays is that they are not power efficient.

## Idea
The Bluetooth Low Energy(BLE) and transistors are comparatively energy efficient. So, I decided to upgrade the door lock opener with BLE.

The idea is to use a BLE based board to be able to still control it over the Internet/cloud. The smart phone sends a request via [cloud](blynk.io), the raspberry-pi acts as a gateway between cloud and the BLE device. 

## Reel Board
The reel board made by [PHYTEC](https://www.phytec.de/produkt/internet-of-things/reelboard/) is equipped with an Epaper Display, environmental sensors, and Blue-tooth connectivity.

## Security 
To keep anyone from hacking away the BLE lock. The opening of the lock involved a challenge response. As soon as the central device connects to the peripheral, it can read the plain-text to which it must provide response after solving it. 

## Connected to the lock

### Intercom wiring diagram
After looking at the multiple Internet forums to look for the wiring diagram for my intercom. I could only find a few links in German language. It pin-outs for the HTS-711 01.

The voltage between the Pin-1 and Pin-7 range from 12-24 Volts DC but they have very limited current available ~ 15mA.

### Blynk.io IoT Cloud
One need to install the andriod app from [blynk.io](https://blynk.io/en/getting-started). Inside the app, it provides some free credits to add different features inside the app. I added a button and a virtual blinking led. After creating the app, it sends the Auth-token needed inside the firmware. The firmware/sketch can be generated from the link below:

## TODO
- Update the source code from raspi and zypher 

## Weather info 
The next step is to add weather support to be displayed over the e-ink display. To save the power the display only gets updated when someone is in-front of the reel board. The IR distance sensor on-board provides distance values.
